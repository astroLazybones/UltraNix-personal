# Mod Support for UNIX

There are 4 categories:
* Out of the Box - Mod works as-is, with no fixes required.
* Fork Available (Prebuilt) - Mod that has a prebuilt fork available on GitHub.
* Fork Available (Untested) - Mod has a fork available, but due to any number of circumstances I have not been able to build the source code. Untested as a result.
* Issues - Contains issues that can only be fixed by the mod author, *usually* related to [not having shaders compiled for glcore](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-compilation.html).
* Borked - Mod does not load, even after attempts to add UNIX compatibility.
