# PROJECT IS DEAD
I have no further interest in working on this, and 7-S seems to not function correctly. If anyone wants to take over maintainership, open a discussion post.

# UltraNix
A set of resources and scripts for porting ULTRAKILL to Linux/MacOS.

## NOTICE:
So I really hoped I wouldn't have to put this here, but:

***DO NOT REPORT BUGS RELATED TO THIS PORT TO ANY OFFICIAL CHANNELS.***

***Unofficial Linux/MacOS support is maintained by coatlessali.***

***Proton support is maintained by [VALVE](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/4406).***

## SPEEDRUNNERS:
**The Mods have spoken.** These ports are **not** speedrun legal. Do not submit runs that were performed on either. **Proton/CrossOver** have been deemed legal for runs, though.

## WIP
This README and associated Wiki are under construction. Thank you.

## Usage
Check [Getting Started](https://github.com/coatlessali/UltraNix/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Okay, but what does this *actually* do?
* Downloads a dummy Unity player for your operating system.
* Copies/Moves necessary files to where the MacOS/Linux UnityPlayers expect them to be, including Steamworks/Discord plugins.
* Symlinks several folders depending on OS. (i.e. `Cybergrind` to `CyberGrind` on Linux to work around a case sensitivity bug.)
